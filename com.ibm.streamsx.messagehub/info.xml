# Additional information

+ What's new and what has changed

This is an overview of changes for major and minor version upgrades. For details see the Releases in public Github.

++ What's new in version 1.7.0

* New **credentials** operator parameter for raw service credentials in JSON for the operators
* The default value for the **commitCount** parameter of the MessageHubConsumer has changed from 500 to 2000.
* SPL types for standard messages have been added to the toolkit

++ What's new in version 1.6.0

* The MessageHubProducer exposes many performance metrics of the producer client as operator metrics
* The most important producer configs have default values, which result in higher reliability and throughput. These are `retries`, `compression.type`, `linger.ms`, `batch.size`, and `max.in.flight.requests.per.connection`.
* New operator parameter **guaranteeOrdering** for the MessageHubProducer, which guarantees that the sequence in a topic partition is the same as the order of tuples in case of retries.
* Queue control for the MessageHubProducer operator to stabilize the maximum queue time and to avoid timeouts sending records
* The MessageHubConsumer operator exposes some performance metrics of the consumer client as operator metrics, like the lag for each topic partition.
