# MessageHub Toolkit Tests

## Setup

Before running the tests, the Event Streams credentials JSON
information must be stored in the `etc/credentials.json` file.
This file should contain the exact JSON as copied from the
Event Streams service, without any modifications.

## Running

```
../../gradlew test
```
