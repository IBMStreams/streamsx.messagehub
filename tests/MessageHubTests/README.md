# MessageHub Toolkit Tests

## Setup

Before running the tests, the MessageHub credentials JSON 
information must be stored in the `etc/messagehub.json` file. 
This file should contain the exact JSON as copied from the 
MessageHub service, without any modifications. 

## Running

```
../../gradlew.sh test
```
